# itp-syllabus-generator
A Syllabus generator for the NYU ITP program


## About

The ITP tradition is to allow faculty and adjucts as much flexibility in their teaching to facilitate creativity and effective/affective student learning. The ITP community has thrived as a result of the richness and diversity of the skills and experiences our faculty bring to the department which can be expressed through the wide range of courses that are offered here.

This tool is meant to help faculty and adjuncts who are submitting new courses to ensure their syllabi fulfill the necessary (and helpful) criteria set by NYU and ITP and abide by the web accessibility standards and the mandatory NYU/Tisch School of Arts Statements on academic integrity, priciple, accessibility, counseling and wellness, and use of electronic devices.

The goal is also to incorporate some of the handy tips and insights that faculty and adjuncts have garnered over the years such that new faculty and adjuncts can best design and plan their courses around the audience of students typically in the ITP and IMA program.
